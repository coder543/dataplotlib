//! **plotter** provides the `Plotter` object which handles plot creation and lifecycles
//!
//! Each plot runs asynchronously in a background thread. A `Plotter` creates and tracks these background threads.
//!
//! For now, `Plotter::plot2d` is the only supported plotting function. It takes a `PlotBuilder2D` containing all needed information.
//!
//! The `Plotter::join` function allows the thread that owns the `Plotter` to wait until the user has closed all open plot windows before continuing.
